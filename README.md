# ORBITAL ALARMüéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: [Name]


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Abhinavgopal M.B - SSET
### Project Description
The Orbital Alarm Clock is a fun, cosmic-themed digital alarm clock where the time is represented by the position of the Earth orbiting around the Sun in 2D. You set the alarm by aligning the Earth‚Äôs position, not just by typing numbers!.We can only 

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People are bored with traditional alarm clocks that use numbers and sounds. What if‚Ä¶ setting an alarm was as fun as rotating the Earth around the Sun?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
A completely unnecessary orbital simulation that lets you set your alarm by rotating the Earth. Because clicking buttons is for peasants. Welcome to the future of waking up ‚Äî where planetary physics meets procrastination.
