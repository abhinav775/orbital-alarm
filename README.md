# ORBITAL ALARMüéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: ABHINAVGOPAL


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Abhinavgopal M.B - SSET
### Project Description
The Orbital Alarm Clock is a fun, cosmic-themed digital alarm clock where the time is represented by the position of the Earth orbiting around the Sun in 2D. You set the alarm by aligning the Earth‚Äôs position, not just by typing numbers!.We can only turn it off by solving a math equation with wrong answer

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People are bored with traditional alarm clocks that use numbers and sounds. What if‚Ä¶ setting an alarm was as fun as rotating the Earth around the Sun?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
A completely unnecessary orbital simulation that lets you set your alarm by rotating the Earth. Because clicking buttons is for peasants. Welcome to the future of waking up ‚Äî where planetary physics meets procrastination.

## Technical Details

the alarm time is set a starts rotating

when the time of alarm reached it started ringing and we can only turn off by solving a math question

but there is a twist in this when we give correct solution the alarm dont stop but when we give wrong answer alarm stops

 here]
the alarm  time is set by draging earth around sun and when time is reached alarm rings and it canbe stopped by give answer to math question but we should give wrong answer to it
